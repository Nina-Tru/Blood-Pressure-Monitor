# Blood-Pressure-Monitor
By using this program, you can quickly and accurately check your blood pressure and get an immediate classification of your blood pressure status. The program also detects abnormal heart rates that may indicate potential health problems. Regular monitoring of blood pressure is an essential aspect of maintaining good health, and our program makes it easy for anyone to track their blood pressure and take action if needed. ####This program includes several functions that are used for monitoring and classifying blood pressure, as well as detecting abnormal heart rates. Here is a summary of the functions and their purposes: get_blood_pressure function checks the input values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and returns a tuple of the validated values. It ensures that the input values are within a valid range and that the diastolic pressure is not higher than the systolic pressure. classify_blood_pressure function classifies the blood pressure based on the systolic and diastolic values. It returns a string indicating the classification, such as "hypotension", "normal", "hypertension stage 1", and so on. calculate_pulse_pressure function calculates the pulse pressure based on the systolic and diastolic values. check_tachycardia_function checks if the heart rate is above 100 beats per minute, which may indicate tachycardia. check_bradycardia_function checks if the heart rate is below 60 beats per minute, which may indicate bradycardia. get_classification_color function returns the color associated with the blood pressure classification string, which is used for displaying the classification in the console output. ####All of these functions work together to provide a comprehensive tool for monitoring and classifying blood pressure, as well as detecting abnormal heart rates. By using these functions, users can quickly and accurately assess their blood pressure and take action if necessary to maintain good health. The program uses color coding to make the output messages more convenient to read. The colorama library is used to initialize the color codes. The output messages are printed in red, green, or yellow colors depending on the type of message. Red color is used when the pulse pressure is out of the normal range. Green color is used for normal blood pressure classification. Yellow color is used for the "normal or prehypertension" classification. Overall, the use of color coding makes it easier for the user to quickly identify important information and potential issues in the output messages.
